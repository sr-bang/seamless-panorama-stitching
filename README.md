### The code can be executed using the wrapper.py from the Phase1 folder. In that file, lines 47-57 are responsible in deciding which image to load. Please uncomment the respective line to read the image.

Both the files default to the Supervised version of the algorithm and must be provided the modeltype argument to change to the unsupervised version. Similarly, both the files must be given the path for checkpoints.
